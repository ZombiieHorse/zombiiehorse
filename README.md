- Mostly just basic DNI criteria, endogenic systems dni, dream supporters dni
- I can and will block/hide however I want, mostly if annoyed or uncomfortable. I do not need to explain myself when I do!
- I don’t really socialize much, more on here for friends and my partner but if you ever want to make sure I notice something just whisper!
- If you fakeclaim I’m just gonna ignore you, you’re not my therapist.

  ☆
  
- I like a lot of things but personally a VERY big fan of minecraft, scp, pokemon, scott pilgrim, marvel, rpg maker horror games and more I'll add later probably
